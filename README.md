# TrafficLightDemo
This project demonstrates an aggregation relationship between two classes in OOP. The project is an event driven OOP project written in Windows Forms for C# that simulates 3 different type of light.
1. **Lamp** - A basic lamp that turns on and off.
2. **Signal Box** - A basic signal box which swaps from red to green.    
3. **Traffic Light** - This is currently unimplemented, follow to TODO comments to modify the code (taken from *SignalBox.cs*) into a basic traffic light

# Instructions
Read through the code, to become familiar with how each object works. Then when you are familiar with the code make adjustments to *TrafficLight.cs* as stated in the TODO comments to change it from a copy of *SignalBox.cs* into a Traffic Light.

# OOP Principles Demonstrated
This project demonstrates **abstraction**, **encapulsation** and **polymorphism** (by overloading) as well as aggreation relationships.
